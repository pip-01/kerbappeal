* Gardening: We will work with you to identify areas which can be improved, make a plan within your budget, and then get stuck into whatever needs doing:  planting, weeding, pruning, weed-eating, mowing, hedge trimming, etc.

* Outdoor tidy: Beautiful planting can be undermined by less than lovely surroundings. We will ensure the whole area is the best it can be by washing and painting decks and fences, removing rubbish, touching up paintwork, and so on.

* Staging: We can enhance your outdoor space further with temporary staging, We will bring in pots, planters, furniture, etc to add style and colour.
